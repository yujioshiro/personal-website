# personal-website
Personal website for me, Yuji Oshiro. This website works only on desktop as scrolling behaviors are different on mobile devices. The mobile/tablet site is a standard website, so definitely check it out on a desktop for the full experience!

# How I built it
This site was built in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no library or framework was used. The graphics were created in Inkscape and the entire project was started on June 16th after about 3 months of studying web development (log can be found below).
