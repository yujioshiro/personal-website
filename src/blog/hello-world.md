### here's your answer
- Yes I'm doing good. Happy as always.
- My family is doing great. We all get along great. Everyone is healthy.
- I am still in school and am transferring to Oregon State University's online Computer Science program.
    - Yes, I have talked to numerous (6) recruiters and all have said that the "online" aspect will not hurt my chances of landing a job.
- I feel like I'm working on an endless list of tasks. The days just feel like a treadmill, but I'll keep pushing.
    - Printing custom t-shirts and merchandise under [merchduck](https://merchduck.com)
    - I want to interview people with something extraordinary, whether it's an experience, unique dreams, or working with special technologies and tools. I think this content will be written and posted on my website. I don't really want to mess with video or visual content right now. I've also been more attracted to text as a medium lately. (there's more info commented out if you want to use dev tools)
        <!-- - Being a child of immigrants, I've always been fascinated by the immigrant experience. I want to bring more of these stories to light and find people who have come to the states with a purpose. If you know anyone that might be interested in sharing their story, I'd love to talk to them.
        - I love the dreamer and I especially love those who are after something not commonly heard of. While I very much respect the software entrepreneurs, content creators, and corporate climbers, I'm after people who want to achieve something that most of us will rarely experience. Things like gold medal contenders, world changing inventions, or researchers working on something very different. 
        - BUT I am also looking for plain interviewing experience and would love to be able to talk about anything and everything with someone. While the main goal with this is to share fascinating people with the internet, I also want to get better at talking to people. -->
    - For my dev friends, I'm thinking about building an open source website similar to rate my professor, but allow students to rate courses along with professors (there's more info commented out if you want to use dev tools)
        <!-- - rate my professor is currently riddled with ads, has a limited word count when reviewing, and because it lacks a lot of rating options I think it makes reviews a bit ambiguous
        - I also want to make it somehow OS so that other college students can get OS experience. I don't know how this will look, but not too worried.
        - I think mainly, I want to build a site that gets A LOT of users and this might be my best idea as of right now. (I'm serious, the rmp site is jank rn) -->
